# Crypto-service

Crypto recommendation service demo with Spring Boot, MySQL and Docker

# Tech stack

Java 17, Spring boot, Gradle

Running in Docker and using MySQL DB

# Build

To build java 17 needs to be installed

`./gradlew build`

# Run

To run, java 17 needs to be installed.

Run locally on a dev env:

`./gradlew bootRun`

Run with docker-compose (as a prerequisite docker and docker-compose need to be installed);

- build the jar with `./gradlew bootJar`
- run with `docker-compose up crypto_service`

# Test coverage

A test coverage report is generated by the Jacoco plugin in build/jacocoHtml , during gradle build command.

For tests, H2 in memory database is used

# Swagger and OpenAPI Spec

After the service is started:

-> run SwaggerUI

http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html

-> generate OpenAPI yaml specs

http://localhost:8081/v3/api-doc.yaml

or run `./gradlew generateOpenApiDocs`

# Technical considerations

Since the data is static, the CryptoPriceService class which implements the business logic of the crypto-service application, has a basic caching implementation. 

If more cryptos are to be added, the service will scale because it reads them into the MySQL database.

If the data volume turns out to be too high, we will migrate to a NoSQL DB like Cassandra

Rate limiting is implemented using ressilience4j
